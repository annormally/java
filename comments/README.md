# Java comments

Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable.

## Single-line Comments

* Single-line comments start with two forward slashes(//).
* Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

## Multiple-line Comments

* Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
* Also like the first example with single-line comments the text between the /* and */ will not be executed.
