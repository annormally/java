# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, there are different types of variables.

### For example:

* String - stores text, such as `"Hello"`.
* int - stores integers, without decimals, such as `13` or `-13`.
* float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as `2.3` or `-2.3`.
* char - stores single characters, such as `'a'` or `'B'`.
* boolean - stores values with two states: `true` or `falase`

## Declaring(Creating) Variables

To create a variable, you must specify the `type` and assign it a `value`.

type variableName = value;

`type` - is one of Java's types (for example int or String)

`valueName` - is the name of the variable(such as x or name)

`value` -

The `equal sign` is used to assign value to the variable.

## Final Variables

However, you can add the `final` keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values.

This will declare variable as `final` or `constant`, which means unchangeable and read-only.

## Display Variables

To combine a text and a variable, use the `+` character.

You can also use the `+` character to add a variable to another variable.

For numeric values, the `+` character works as a mathematical operator.

## Declare Many Variables

To declare more than one variable of the `same type`, use a comma-separated list.

## Java Identifiers

All Java `variables` must be `identified` with `unique names`.

The unique names are called `identifiers`.

Identifiers can be short names like x and y or more descriptive names like sum, average, age.

`Note:` It is recommended to use descriptive name in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

## The general rules for naming variables are:

* Names can contains letters, digits, underscores, and dollar sign.
* Names must begin with a letter.
* Names should start with a lowercase letter, and it cannot contain whitespace.
* Names can also begin with $ and _.
* Names are case-sensitive (`"myVar"` and `"myvar"` are different variables).
* Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as `int` or `boolean`) cannot be used as names.
